# LocalGradientsReview
Data from Starko et al. (2024). Impacts of marine heatwaves in coastal ecosystems depend on local environmental condition. Global Change Biology.

This repository contains data for two figures from Starko et al. (2024). The file structure is as follows:

"Fig 6 - meta-analysis" folder
  - "LocalGradients_MetaAnalysis_data.xlsx" - this file contains the data extracted from the 25 case studies. Metadata (including field descriptions) are given in the "metadata" sheet

"Fig 7 - kelp case studies" folder
  - "BarkleySound_KelpSites.xlsx" - this file contains the data on kelp presence-absence in Barkley Sound before and after the 2014-2016 MHW. Metadata (including field descriptions) are given in the "metadata" sheet
    
  - "LoggerData_BarkleySound.xlsx" - this file contains summaries of in situ temperature data for sites across Barkley Sound. Metadata (including field descriptions) are given in the "metadata" sheet
    
  - "NorwaySiteLocations.xlsx" - this file contains the data on kelp survival in Norway from Filbee-Dexter et al. 2020 Scientific Reports. Metadata (including field descriptions) are given in the "metadata" sheet

Raw temperature data and code used to generate in situ temperatures for the Barkley Sound case study in Fig 7 can be found at:
